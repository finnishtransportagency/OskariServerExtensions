<p> Would you like to add map layers to a map view? Read this guide to know how to add map layers, change the settings for map layers and make feature data related to the map layer visible.</p>
<h2> Add map layers to a map view</h2>
<p> The map layers available can be found in the Map Layers menu. Search for map layers using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Browse map layers according to theme.</li>
   <li> Browse map layers according to data producer. The data producer is the organisation producing the map layer.</li>
   <li> Type a search term in the search field. The search term can be the name of a dataset or a data producer or a keyword. You can replace the end of a search term with an asterisk (*).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Selected layers</h2>
<p> In the Selected Layers menu, you can see the map layers you have selected and change their settings and order.</p>
<p> The selected map layers are listed in a list where the topmost map layer of the map view is on top. You can change the order of the map layers by dragging them up and down in the list. By adjusting a map layer's opacity, you can control whether the map layers underneath the map layer in question are visible through it. In addition, you can select the style for some map layers. You can also hide or show desired map layers.</p>
<p> In the Selected Layers menu, you can check whether a map layer you have selected can be published on your website by using the Map Publishing function.</p>
<h2> Feature data</h2>
<p> If the data product (dataset) contains feature data, you can view the feature data of the data product via the Selected Layers menu.</p>
<p> It is possible to view feature data also via the Feature Data link below the zoom bar. Moreover, it is possible to view the data of a particular feature by clicking the location on the map. The pop-up window shows the location's attribute data of all selected map layers containing feature data.</p>
<p> The tabs of the feature data table contain all selected map layers containing feature data. The table contains all features and their attribute data that are visible in the map view of the map layer. You can sort the data of the features by clicking the column title.</p>
<p> You can select features by clicking them either on the map or in the table. Selected features are highlighted in yellow in the table and on the map. You can select several features at the same time by holding down the CTRL key while clicking the features.</p>
<p> You can save the feature data on your own computer either in an Excel table or a CSV file. Click "Export dataset", select the desired options and finally click "Export".</p>
<h2> Map Legends</h2>
<p> You can see the map legends for selected map layers in the Map Legends menu. The map legends show the map symbols and colours used. Click the i icon to see the metadata of the map layer. Map legends are available only for some of the map layers.</p>
