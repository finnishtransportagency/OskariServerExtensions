<p>Would you like to focus the map on a specific place or find a map layer for a specific purpose? You can search for places and spatial data by using the Search tool.</p>
<h2>Location search</h2>
<p>By using Location search, you can search for places. Write a search term in the search field and press the Search button. The search term may be:</p>
<ul>
   <li>A place name</li>
   <li>An address</li>
</ul>
<p>You can cut the search term by ending it with an asterisk (*). For example, if you type "Hels*", the result includes all the place whose name or address starts with "Hels". If you use an asterisk, the search term must contain at least four other characters.</p>
<h2>Metadata search</h2>
<p>By using Metadata Search, you can search for spatial data resources, that is datasets, dataset series and services. You can type a search term in the search field or use pre-defined search options. You can search by dataset name, data provider and keywords.</p>
<p>Type a search term in the search field. Allowed characters are letters (a-รถ, A-ร), numbers (0-9), period (.), comma (,), hyphen (-) and exclamation mark (!). You can replace one character in the search term with a question mark (?). You can replace the end of a search term with an asterisk (*). If you use an asterisk, the search term must contain at least four other characters.</p>
